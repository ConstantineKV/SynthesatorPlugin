# SynthesizerPlugin
This JUCE project was created only for discovering and testing basic JUCE and Maximillian library functions. 

To properly work of this project you should download JUCE 6.0.4 to your machine by path C:\JUCE.  

In this project Maximillian library had been used. I downloaded it from https://github.com/micknoise/Maximilian. 

I used it for testing:
- Creating similar sound wave types
- ADSL
- Filters

Thanks to all engineers working on JUCE and Maximillian.
